						<h2 class="title">Answering the Challenges of 21st Century Education</h2>
						
						<p class="tabs-p">
							In the 21st century, the unprecedented social power of knowledge-driven professions makes
							creative understanding of young students key to universities' contributing to society. This is based on
							their core intellectual competencies. Universities are engines of both individual empowerment and
							social progress. The very same creative understanding that empowers individuals to lead productive
							lives as citizens and professionals also generates social progress.</p> 
							<br>
						<p class="tabs-p">
							What makes university education worthwhile? An education that cultivates creative understanding
							enables diverse, talented, hardworking graduates to pursue productive careers, to enjoy the
							pleasures of lifelong learning, and to reap the satisfactions of creatively contributing to society.</p>
							<br>


							<p class="tabs-p">
							The corresponding institutional vision & mission of THE GLOBAL UNIVERSITY(BTU) must take into
							consideration the following value systems:
						</p>
						<br>


						<ul>
							<li>The Search for Truth - In the ideal academic setting scholars have the time and resources to
								search for truths within their fields. Among all scientists, developing theories that will
								explain how the world works is a fundamental part of that search for truth. This freedom
								should not be lost. In other words, development of research is critical to the progress of any
								university.</li>
							<li>Freedom to pursue all ideas - Strongly related to the quest for truth is a second feature of
								the ideal academic setting: it is a space in which people are free to pursue all ideas without
								any discrimination. BTU must become a centre of independent thought.</li>
							<li>Respect for knowledge & expertise - Part of respecting expertise and valuing truth and
								knowledge for its own sake includes understanding that people cannot predict ahead of time
								what might turn out to be an important discovery, and that we must protect the ability of
								scholars to pursue ideas that may seem improbable but might provide a crucial key to our
								understanding.</li>
							<li>Creativity & innovation - the core intellectual aim of a university education is to foster
								creativity & innovation in the students and faculty. It calls for a greater integration of
								knowledge not only within the liberal arts and sciences but also between the liberal arts and
								professional education. Both are prerequisites to the ultimate aim of education: young
								citizens who can act in a well-informed way to benefit society.</li>
							<li>Merit - within the given policy framework of education, a university must function on
								meritocracy. All the students, irrespective of descent and prospects, are on a completely
								equal footing. It is important to overcome the vague definitions of what constitutes merit in
								our education system to truly make BTU a university that recognises & rewards merit.</li>
							<li> Inclusiveness - tightly related to the ideal of meritocracy, is the notion that academic
								institutions should be inclusive. Our motto at BTU should be we are open to everyone and
								include everyone who shares only their quest for knowledge and commitment to pursuing
								truth, creativity and innovation, and the other virtues of higher education.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="tabs-p">An inspiring vision & mission statements will also lay the foundation for a university that can in
							future become a global institute of eminence.</p>
