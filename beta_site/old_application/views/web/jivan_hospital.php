									<b>Jivan Hospital</b> is located at Kakching, a small picturesque town in the North Eastern state of Manipur in India – just 60 Kms from the Indo-Myanmar border at a stone drop distance from the junction of the two national highways: NH-102 (Trans Asian Highway) and NH-137B.

									</p>

									<p>Started in 2011 by <b>Dr Y Ashok</b> with a single sharp vision to sArunachal Pradeshe people of this place and the neighbouring districts where good health care accessibility was a distant dream then.</p>
Arunachal Pradesh
									<p>Pushed by a chronic desire to do something in the same place where he grew up. In his own words…“In my childhood I have seen many near and dear ones meet many avoidable deaths which could have been saved by a simple first aid procedure in health care.  So, my dream has been to establish a hospital in this part of the country with a vision to start basic medical training centres like Paramedical and nursing institute to enable and inculcate basic medical knowledge which could be of some help to the people of this region in solving basic health problems”.</p>

									<p>The dream took wings on the 1st April 2011, when <b>Dr Y Ashok</b> with the support of his childhood friend-now-turned wife <b>Dr N Jivanlata Devi</b>, a renowned Gynaecologist, started Jivan hospital. The dream still fires both the doctor couple even today with more renewed rigour every single day.  </p>

									<p>With a 250 bed building capacity, at present it’s a 100 bedded hospital with around 150 staffs in an area of 12 acres with the following facilities presently :</p>

									<ol>

										<li>Fully automated lab (NABL approved)</li>

										<li>Sixteen Slice Spiral CTs</li>

										<li>Digital X-Ray 600 MA and Portable X-Ray 100 MA</li>

										<li>C- Arm (Scan-C)</li>

										<li>Four Ultrasound machine latest with Samsung Medison HS70A</li>

										<li>Fully equipped 4 bedded Trauma ICU</li>

										<li>Two major and two minor operation theatres</li>

										<li>Self-sufficient oxygen generator</li>

										<li>Three advanced life support and one basic life support ambulance</li>

									</ol>

									<p>Various other facilities are further still planned additionally.</p>

									<p>The hospital also actively participates in social spheres through:</p>

									<ol>

										<li>Regular free health camp with all the ambulance and staff in the villages</li>

										<li>Actively participating with the government in all the national calamities like flood and Covid-19 pandemic etc</li>

										<li>Sponsoring with scholarship for Below Poverty Line medical students since 2009. As on date, the total beneficiaries stand at 30 doctors </li>

										<li>Active participation and pushing local sport activities physically and sponsoring prizes like DSA football and 2nd World War Marathon</li>

										<li>Appreciation award given every year for UPSC successful candidates of Kakching</li>

										<li>The first group of Hospitals who signed MOU with Honourable CM of Manipur to start PMJAY & CMHT  Health scheme for poor people.</li>

										<li>As part of the commitment to bettering lives, Jivan Hospital is the first one to start 40kV rooftop Solar Grid in Manipur - setting the example of initiating renewable energy with the actual work being done.</li>

									</ol>

									<p>Besides the non-hospital look of the compound, it doesn’t have the “regular hospital smell” and Dr Ashok personally has been ensuring the same without compromising on the cleanliness part. Also don’t take our word for it, but do check out the public rest room in the compound to see for yourself.</p>

									<p>This is also the only private hospital with consultant’s family quarters.</p>

									<p>Though only a month shy from completing 10 years in serving, Jivan hospital still has a long journey planned ahead in the service of the people. </p>
