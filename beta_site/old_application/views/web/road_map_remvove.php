                            <h2 class="">Answering the Challenges of 21st Century Education</h2>
							<p>
							We are fortunate to set up a university in the times of a global pandemic. Everything around us is
evolving in new patterns. As our national economies are increasingly interdependent, the old
certainties of power centres are being challenged and new powerhouses are emerging to challenge
old authorities.</p>
<p>
As technology changes and develops, employment and daily life are being radically reshaped with
whole categories of employment being created and others disappearing. New professions will
emerge which require new skills, but more importantly, a greater ability to understand and embrace
change along with the ability to adapt and think creatively will be necessary.</p>
<p>
It is critical to have a roadmap that will be the guiding force behind our functioning. While the focus
is there on undergraduate & post graduate programs, some thought must be given to the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Manipur has a small but literate population of approx. 28 Lakh.</li>
<li>The literacy level is over 87% and 73%, respectively, for male and female population of the
state.</li>
<li>The state has over 1 Lakh students attending various college and university courses in the
state.</li>
<li>There are existing Govt and Private Universities in Manipur offering practically all courses.</li>
<li>Two central universities, namely, Central Agricultural University and Manipur University.</li>
<li>There are a host of other premium technical, medical and domain specific universities and
institutes including Manipur Technical University, National Institute of Technology – NIT
Manipur, Manipur International University, Manipur Institute of Technology, Indian Institute
of Information Technology, Manipur, Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences,
Regional Institute of Medical Sciences, Manipur University of Culture and National Sports
University.</li>
<li> The students also have an option to enrol in multitude of Distance Learning Courses offered
by various UGC approved Universities and Institutes from across the country.</li>

</ul>
<h2>It is also a fact that:</h2>
<ul>
<li>It will take some time for BTU to start “Physical” classes as our own infra will take a long
time and even leased premises will take time to be activated.</li>
<li>It may not be that easy for students to come and attend “Physical” classes in a brand new
private university.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Considering the above:</h2>
<ul>
<li>It would make huge sense for BTU to start from THIS ACADEMIC SESSION itself though as a
“DIGITAL University”.</li>
<li>UGC allows it.</li>
<li>It would be also be best to create “Market Presence and Recall” as “Digital” would enable
the maximum reach.</li>
<li>In fact digital would enable them to reach out to students in other states too.</li>
<li> Can offer a range of courses based on availability of content.</li>
<li>Offer the Same Course in English + Manipuri + 5 additional spoken languages in Manipur
using Voiceovers - Tangkhul, Kuki, Lusai, Hmar, Paite and Thadou . All 5 are the language of
instructions in schools and examinations. Incidentally, Manipuri has its own script and is
known as the Meitei Mayek.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Besides the above, we can during the academic year focus on:
</h2>

<p>- Programs to “Structure” the Local Skills available with majority of the population for them to
become a Viable Business which can expand nationally and even globally. Creation of a
Specialized Entrepreneurial Program and not general one will enable the local population to
seek.</p>
<p> - Programs to understand the nuances of Content Development for various platforms – Social
Media at different Levels, Blogs, Websites, Corporate and Personal etc. It is NOT about
learning the tools such as Adobe BUT more about Content Strategy, Content Curation,
Content Efficacy and Content Distribution, The Need for Rich Contextual Content. This is the
most important aspect in the New Normal Digital Environment, for nearly every
organization, government and private, as there are enough platforms, tools, mediums but
very few resources who can use them effectively. The added advantage is that Manipur has
a strong English base.</p>
<p> - Second Career Programs : Many among the NE population do not have a job post 40-50
years and while they have basic and even advance education, most are left to fend for
themselves. With the tightening of belt everywhere, there will also be reverse movement of
talent from other states back to Manipur (From Bangalore, Pune, Mumbai, Delhi etc). So, an
advanced programs for Reskill, Additional Skill, Enhance Skill of such “Adult” Population can
also go a long way in making BTU an institute with a difference. </p>
