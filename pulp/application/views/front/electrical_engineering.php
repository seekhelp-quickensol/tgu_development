    M.Tech is a two-year professional technical degree course and postgraduate program in engineering. During the duration of two years, students are given exceptional knowledge of technologies. M.Tech enhances the skills of a candidate and makes him or her specialist in a particular area or field.

    </p>

    <p>Many times, candidates are found to be confused between the M.Tech and M.E programs. One of the major differences between the two is that M.E is basically a theory-based program, whereas M.Tech is an application-based program.</p>
